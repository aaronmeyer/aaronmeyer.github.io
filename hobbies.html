	<h3>My favorite hobby is watching college football all day on saturday. 
	I watch college gameday from 9 am to 12pm then 
	watch the games from 12pm to 2 am (which is usually when the 10:30 games end)</h3>
	<p>Tutorial: If you have an Xbox and you want to watch all these games, go to the Xbox store and download the Youtube TV app. The next thing to do is hook up your tv provider wether its Spectrum, Verizon, etc and put in your usernames and passwords. The final step is to make sure you pay the X amount of money it is per month and then you are set to go!</p>
	<p>Why this my favorite hobby: The biggest reason that this is my favorite thing to do is because I got my love of Football from my Dad and Uncle. They both grew up playing football and have watched football their entire lives. So one day I watched college football and now I'm a fanatic for life!
