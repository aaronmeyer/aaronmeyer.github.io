            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>The importance of using descriptive file names for image files is that it keeps everything organized. If you want to make it shorter than rename it so it looks better.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The application I used was Paint.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image was 2121 x 1414 pixels.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="C:\Users\aaron.meyer\Pictures\html5.jpg"
			alt="Person drawing HTML 5"
			height="1414"
			width="2121">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used compressor.io.Before the uncompressed size was 1414 by 2121. The newly compressed picture is now 500 by 333.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="C:\Users\aaron.meyer\Pictures\html5.jpg"
			alt="Person drawing HTML 5"
			height="333"
			width="500">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>The biggest know change is that the new picture is smaller.</p>
